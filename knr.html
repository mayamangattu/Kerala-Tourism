      Kannur is one among the northernmost districts in the south western state of Kerala in India.
      With the Western Ghats in the east and lakshadweep sea in the west,
      kannur district is bounded by a wealth of natural beauty. Kannur is blessed with natural beaches,
      hill stations, rivers, backwaters, historical monuments and religious centres.
      The district itself which shares much of the natural splendour has been a key contributor
      to the cultural, religious, political and industrial heritage of the state. In addition,
      Kannur enjoys the credit of having been the cradle of many a colourful folk art and folk music of Kerala.
      Kannur is rightly described as “The land of Looms and Lores”. Kannur is well known for its handlooms.
